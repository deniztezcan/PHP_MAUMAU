# PHP_MAUMAU
A non-interactive PHP version of the game mau mau (pesten)

## Rules
 - Shuffle a deck of 52 playing cards (no Jokers). Pass seven cards to each player. The remainder is called the stack.
 -  At the beginning of the game the topmost card is revealed, then the players each get a turn to play cards.
 -  One can play a card if it corresponds to the suit or value of the open card. E.g. on a 10 of spades, only other spades can be played or other 10s. If a player is not able to play, they should draw one card from the stack
 -  Once the drawing stack is empty, the player will have to skip a turn if he / she cannot play a card.
 -  Whoever gets rid of his/her cards first wins the game.
